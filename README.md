# 2048-android-kotlin
2048 android game, by kotlin.

Author of this improved version: Mārcis Teodors Upenieks  // email: marcisreb@gmail.com

*   Original (Incomplete project) this one is built upon -> https://github.com/Obdormio/2048-android-kotlin
*   You can compare this repo for code that I have written on top.

Features that were already built by original author:
  - Game Board Foundation
  - One rectangle that was generated by default
  - Cool animation (Still trying to figure out how it animates :])
  - File structure (
      UnitManager: class that creates Rectangles and updates the game state,
      RectUnit: holds color and position properties, etc
      )
___
Features/add-ons I implemented:
  - Game Logic (Collision detection and rectangle position change depending on swipe direction)
  - Changed and added different colors for rectangles
  - Added score textView and Button for reset (If game reaches state where board is full of rectangles without possible moves)
  - Had to change SDK version to 30 and rebuild project since original was from 2018 and had 28 as sdk version.

Things I tried but didn't succeed with:
  - Original author used drawing on Canvas so there is no use of activity_main.xml as in our learning material.
      So trying to combine these two was nightmare/or maybe it is not, because this is my very first time developing on android platform.
  - Since there is no xml file, instead of data binding or using something called kotlin extensions
      I brute forced Context down from MainActivity trough GameView to UnitManager to access getString().
      Also passed scoreView to GameView but there is obviously a better way. Just didn't find it yet. :/
